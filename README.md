# FingerBows

Check the branches, there are builds for HoloLens 2, Quest 2 Passthrough Overlay, Quest 2 Passthrough Underlay, and Quest 2 AR/VR 
(which means it can switch between AR and VR).

I think FingerBows is a good idea because it brings the fun aspect of archery and hitting your target into AR/VR,
where a virtual crossbow can follow your finger, no real actual arrows can hurt anyone, and youâ€™re able to 
see the world around you at all times. 

The FingerBows prototype works on the Quest 2/ Pro and HoloLens 2. Users will have a crossbow on the backs 
of their index finger and be able to shoot a variety of targets via hand interactions. The user will be able to play
a variety of archery minigames with their FingerBow while still aware of the physical world around them.

This project was built on Joost van Schaik's project.
