# FingerBows

I want to prove that it is easy to make a fun handtracking game for the Quest 2 and HoloLens 2.

I think FingerBows is a good idea because it brings the fun aspect of archery and hitting your target into AR,
where a virtual crossbow can follow your finger, no real actual arrows can hurt anyone, and youâ€™re able to 
see the world around you at all times. 

The FingerBows prototype will work on the Quest 2/ Pro and HoloLens 2. Users will have a crossbow on the backs 
of their index finger and be able to shoot a variety of targets via hand interactions. The user will be able to play
a variety of archery minigames with their FingerBow while still aware of the physical world around them.

This project was built on Joost van Schaik's project.
